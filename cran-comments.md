# REPSD v1.0.0

This is a new release to CRAN. This packages provides a new nonparametric DIF 
measure for IRT item analysis. Helper functions provide additional utility,
including a plot function to demonstrate the shape of the user-generate null 
distribution of REPSD values and the location of the observed REPSD value in that
distribution.

It has been tested on:

- A local Windows 11 install
- On R-hub
- With `devtools::check_win_devel`

The only NOTES are for spelling issues which, upon inspection, are not actual issues.
